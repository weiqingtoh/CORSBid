These are some of the questions we will be engaging with in this course. There are two segments to the course. In the first segment, we will examine general theories of statereligion relations, including liberal assumptions of the dominant theory of the separation of church and state (the \u201cdisestablishment theory\u201d), the rise and fall of the secularization thesis, and alternative theories. During the second segment, we will examine statereligion relations through topical issues in selected countries in Southeast Asia, including how legal systems in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia accommodate Syariah Courts, and how separationist claims based on religious difference and identities are advanced in the Philippines and Thailand.",

  "description": "This is a course that is meant for two important marketing mix variables, channel management and pricing. In Channel Management, not much attention is usually paid to understanding marketing channels in detail. In fact people used to call channels the `dark continent? of marketing, that is best left to `truckers?. But, is this true? One can make at least four observations: long term commitment of channel related decisions, existence of channel `power play,? market dynamics caused by channel changes, and the impact of internet on channel intermediaries. All these issues are very difficult to comprehend and solve if we do not understand `what channels are for?? Channel management is not just managing the retailers and the trucks and delivery personnel, but it is much larger than that. In Pricing, the one element of marketing strategy that is least understood and hence constantly feared by many managers is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. On one hand, it is supposed to reflect all the strategic steps the company has taken to bring the product to the consumer and convince him/her to buy it as well. On the other hand, it is supposed to reflect what the consumer would get out of the product by paying that price to acquire it. Will there be a match between the two? Perhaps and perhaps not. This dilemma makes it imperative for a manager needs to understand and analyze various factors in arriving at an appropriate pricing strategy. And, pricing does not operate in vacuum. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management we discuss in this course. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run.",

These are followed by analyses for convective heat transfer and heat transfer with phase change, and subsequently radiative heat transfer. Heat exchangers and their design are discussed. Steady and unsteady-state molecular diffusion is studied, while convective mass transfer is analyzed using exact and approximate integral analysis. Finally, analogies between mass, heat and momentum transfer are discussed leading to the concept of transport phenomena.",

This module, requiring no background in biology or science history, will provide a solid background for understanding how the history of the theory of evolution actually unfolded. The course covers the history of geology, paleaontology and biology from the 1700s to the 20th century. The central focus is on the life and work of Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and how biological evolution was uncovered and accepted by the international scientific community in the 19th century, and beyond. There are case studies on how to assess historical claims and evidence. The final 3 or 4 lectures discuss recent developments in evolutionary biology.",

  "description": "A number of animals use venoms to capture their prey. These venoms are a mixture of toxins which attack critical life-supporting systems including nerve transmission and blood circulation. Studies of individual toxins help us not only to understand how they assist in prey capture, but also to use them in developing new drug leads for the treatment of some of the leading causes of human death. In this module students will explore the beneficial side of animal toxins. They will find out information about how some of the life-saving drugs were designed and developed based on toxin structure through case studies in groups. They will also participate in discussions on toxinbased drugs for some of devastating diseases such as heart attack, stroke and cancer. Students will have opportunities to make individual and team oral presentations and written reports. This freshman seminar is suitable for both life science and non-life science majors.",

  "description": "The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to the roles of randomness in scientific thinking. Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren\u2019t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?",

The study of civilmilitary relations addresses a simple puzzle: can we have a military strong enough to protect civilians yet not so strong as to ignore or subvert civilian authority? A military strong enough to defend the state from external enemies is also strong enough to seize power. How can a state have a strong military capability without being dominated by it? How do political leaders and military organizations interact with each other and with the larger society, and how do their cultures overlap and diverge.",

  "description": "This course will consider the legal regime which applies to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea. The carriage of goods by sea forms an important component of a wider body of law which is called maritime (or shipping) law. The subject matter of this course also forms a part of the (private) law of international trade and will assist those students studying international sales of goods and bank payment mechanisms in international trade, and insurance and marine insurance. All these subjects are invaluable to anyone who aspires eventually to work in shipping or international trade, whether as a lawyer in a law firm, as a legal adviser in-house, in insurance in a P & I Club, or for a marine insurer. Carriage of Goods by Sea is a core area of shipping law. The principal purpose which underlines this course is the carriage of cargo from one destination to another for profit. The seller/owner of goods who wishes to export them will hire a ship (particularly in the case of bulk commodities, such as oil) or space on a ship, depending on the quantity and type of goods to be transported. This course is therefore concerned with examining the legal relationships which arise between the shipper (or owner of the goods), the carrier (the shipowner), the charterer, and the receiver/consignee of the goods. The particular emphasis will be the principal documents of carriage, such as bills of lading, sea waybills and ship\u2019s delivery orders, and the domestic legislation which governs these documents and also gives effect to international conventions. The coverage of international conventions will include the Rotterdam Rules, even though these Rules are not yet in force.

Basically, the module is divided into 5 major parts: (a) static analysis, (b) comparative static analysis, (c) dynamic analysis, (d) optimization problems and mathematical programming, and (e) welfare economics. The mathematical tools appropriate for each are then introduced in due order within the economic framework of each topic. The module is expected to provide students with a clear understanding of the numerous existing economic models, including models of the market, of the firm, and of the consumer, national income models, input-output models, and models of economic growth.",

Sign use makes possible not only such higher-order human abilities as spoken language and written texts, but also underlies such communicative animal behaviour as the calls and songs of birds and cetaceans; the pheromone trails of insect colony organisation and interaction; the mating, territorial, and hierarchical display behaviour in mammals; as well as the deceptive scents, textures, movements and coloration of a wide variety of symbiotically interacting insects, animals and plants. This course will introduce you to the recently developed field of biosemiotics the interdisciplinary study of sign processes as they occur variously across the biological spectrum. Looking at the close relation between living systems and their sign systems (hence the term: bio-semiotics), this still-emerging discipline seeks to traces the evolutionary development of sign-mediated ways of being in the world from its beginnings in the transmission of information across single cells to its most complicated realisation in the abstract forms of human thought.",

The core of the module is the canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field and the introduction of the corresponding vector space (\u201cFock space\u201d) and field operators. Then, we present the main families of states (number, thermal, coherent, squeezed) and the most typical measurement techniques (photo-detection, homodyne measurement, first- and second-order coherence, Hong-Ou-\\Mandel bunching). The statistical nature of light fields is highlighted. Finally, we present the basic case studies of photon-atom interactions in the full quantum approach: cavity quantum electrodynamics (Janyes-Cummings model), spontaneous decay (Wigner-Weisskopf approach).",

  "description": "This course deals with the study of human behavior in organisations: how people influence organisational events and how events within the organisation influence people's behaviour. Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation. The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on. In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?",

It examines the relationships between population health and development issues, and the different approaches and methods of social policy utilized to compare present and future health and population-related challenges. Past experiences of population growth, movement and decline and the longer term effects on health and related sectors will also be studied with their policy implications. The course takes a systematic life-cycle approach and is a practice-based and policy-oriented module. The practical applications of public health and population sciences are thus employed to the organization of public programs to meet the needs of specific population agegroups. In practice, existing government departments in Ministries of Health or Ministries of Social Welfare have been organized to deliver social services by age-groups - from birth to death across childhood, youth, adulthood and old age. Similarly, the organization of the class schedule takes on such a structure, and will have participation from invited practitioners from relevant government agencies. Selected regional experiences in population health policies and programs will be analysed in various casestudies. Seminar topics on current topical issues include comparative national population policies, family planning and reproductive health, maternal and child health, adolescent health, adult health, health of the elderly, endof-life issues, population ageing and the future of population health in Asia.",

Currently there are three major types of information storage technologies, i.e., magnetic data storage, optical disks, and solid-state memories. Although the operation principles are different, the common driving force for all these surface-based information storage technologies in the last few decades was the reduction of bit size so as to make it possible to store more data on a specific surface area. As a result, all these data storage devices are now operating in the nanometer regime. This module adopts a model-based approach to introduce information storage through focusing on the basic principles of various types of data storage systems and the associated roles of nanotechnology in each field. Emphasis will be on materials, devices and technologies that have made it possible to maintain a remarkable growth rate in storage density in the last decades and emerging technologies for tackling challenges ahead.

  "description": "There are literally thousands of chemical reactions in the field of organic chemistry, but only a handful of them are most relevant to non-chemists (e.g. life scientists). The term bioorthogonal chemistry refers to some of these chemical reactions that can occur inside living systems without interfering with native biochemical processes. Since its introduction, the concept of the bioorthogonal reaction has enabled the study of many types of biomolecules under native cellular environments. In recent years, it has been expanded to many other fields, materials, nanotechnology and engineering. This seminar is intended for junior undergraduates who are interested in equipping themselves with a few very basic but essential set of organic reactions which are most relevant to non-specialists. The module will be conducted in the form of seminar discussion and presentations in a highly interactive manner. Both students and the professor will learn hand-in-hand about the subject of interest, and the students will be required to participate actively in twoway discussion. By using key examples in bioorthogonal chemistry developed in the last decade, the students will focus on interactive learning in unconventional ways (reading, literature search, group discussion, independent studies, presentation, etc).

Examples are plentiful, such as \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular Genetics\", \"Molecular Electronics\", \"Molecular Medicine\", \"Molecular Informatics\", \"Molecular Engineering\", \"Molecular Pharmacology\", \"Molecular Ecology\", \"Molecular Machines\"... etc. In the \"Science of Molecules\" viz. \"Chemistry\", the focus is on molecular design, molecular structure, molecular synthesis, molecular activity and molecular function. The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design. Molecular structures therefore are the fundamentals in molecular science. In this seminar series, we shall discuss with the class the underlying principles of chemical structures, with specific focus on the interrelationship among the five S's of molecules -Science, Structure, Stability, Symmetry, and, Space. The mode of teaching and learning focuses on group learning, interaction, independent enquiry, project work, molecular models, and public presentations. Writing and presentations are essential elements in this freshmen seminar. There will also be hands-on sessions on molecular models and molecular origami.

  "description": "Process Analysis and Redesign is a systematic approach to helping an organization analyze and improve its processes. In this course the term \u2018redesign\u2019 includes \u2018reengineering\u2019. All systems are designed and developed to support business processes. Therefore, an understanding of the business processes is crucial to choosing how to build and manage systems, re-skill personnel and retool the infrastructure. A business process is a collection of activities that creates an output that is of value to some customer. Business processes can be improved at any level of an organization or can be improved across multiple organizations. Typically, Business Process Redesign/Reengineering (BPR) uses information technology to enable business process change in order to reduce costs, improve service, and reduce cycle times. Several BPR methodologies exist. Most methodologies require the construction of an \u201cAs-Is\u201d and \u201cTo-Be\u201d model. This course will discuss the role of BPR in managing technology and the operational functions. The course will cover the strategic, operational and technological dimensions of BPR in the context of quality improvement, Information Technology and business operations. Case studies will provide real-world context for the concepts discussed in class. The course is designed to teach students BPR methodologies and modeling techniques that accompany the methodology. Students will identify an organization (or part of an organization) that needs improvement. Next, they will analyze the current system, investigate possible Information Technology and operational solutions, redesign the current system and propose a plan to move from the \u201cAs-Is\u201d system to the \u201cTo-Be\u201d system.",

The new commitment of the co-habitation of nature and built environment has drawn attentions of the architects, urban designers and environmental professionals. The discourses of urban sustainability have to move away from social sufficiency, ecological efficiency to ecosystem compatibility by linking the forms and flows of urban, industrial and natural systems. The new challenges of urban ecological issue require design and environmental professionals to deal with how urban and environment spaces could be analyzed, designed, managed, evaluated, represented and changed for responding to the cutting-edge sustainable issues. Divided by two main categories, Spatial Typologies and Ecological Flows, the series of lecture covers the trends and issues of sustainable urban design and development. Following the introductory lecture based on planning and design history, the Part One Spatial Typologies includes global ecological effects of mega urban form, suburbanization and propositions of sustainable city, downtown urban design, waterfront revitalization and brown field redevelopment. The Part Two Ecological Flows covers the ecological design issues of landscape ecological flow, material and energy flow, water flow and informational flow. The sessions conclude with the discussion of representational dimension of urban and environmental design that is essential to the professional practices of ecologically sound urban and environmental design. By selecting one of the specific sustainable urban issues, students are required to work on a research project, which is to be presented as a team work during the semester and further developed as an individual term paper at the end of semester.",

  "description": "The development of mathematical concepts and theories is often influenced by an intuition acquired from physical experience and by analogy with various areas of scientific and mathematical knowledge. Analogy is an important factor in preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition can sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to present case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the ground-breaking importance of \"counter-intuition\" in modern mathematics. A wealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis, algebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this module are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the internet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on the spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery. To illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some elementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and discussion. The main prerequisite for this module is an inquiring mind open to new ideas.

Very often misleading claims in science and in society more generally can arise from an ignorance of basic statistical ideas, but statistical methods can also be abused knowingly in fraudulent behaviour. On the other hand, statistical methods are also commonly used to detect and uncover fraud and dishonesty. After first looking at different kinds of deception involving data and the motivations for it this seminar will discuss the role of statistics in uncovering deception in areas such as: 1. Misleading claims in health; 2. Misleading surveys and opinion polls; 3. Claims and counterclaims in environmental science; 4. Fraud detection in the financial world; 5.

Are they speculation or fact? How do we know? Of what use are they? How have they shaped our lives? In this module we will retrace the key ideas that led Einstein to his formulation of the Special Theory of Relativity, and how the concepts evolved through various personalities to produce the elegant spacetime version of the theory, culminating in the General Theory of Relativity. Along the way we will see the practical application of the scientific method and clarify common misconceptions of the theory. We will also study the impact Relativity has had on science, technology, philosophy and culture, and have a peek at the research frontier, where gravity and quantum theory meet, to be aware of open problems. Synopsis Einstein\u2019s insight was that time must be relative, in contrast to Newton\u2019s assumption of an absolute time. Time dilation (\u201cmoving clocks run slow\u201d) is easily derived from Einstein\u2019s postulates and it immediately implies a range of related effects such as the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction. These phenomena are seen to be interconnected through the formulation of a Minkowskian spacetime, which unites, and generalizes, Euclid\u2019s space with Newton\u2019s time. A further generalization leads to the General Theory of Relativity which shows gravity to be an effect of a dynamical curved spacetime, the framework for cosmology.",

No longer is human influence on the planet confined to the local environment, but now extends across political boundaries - often resulting in regional or even global impacts. As a result, society, industry and agriculture are under increasing pressure to improve environmental performance and cut resource consumption and pollution. Around the world, governments are striving to minimise waste production, protect water resources, reduce energy consumption and improve the quality of the urban living environment. As the human global population grows exponentially and the life-support systems of the planet continue to deteriorate, there is a growing international recognition that environmental problems require truly global solutions. This course will focus on the issues and causes of global environmental issues including: population growth, resource exploitation and threats to the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere.

It then moves on to the open economy with trade and capital flows. Key issues covered here include the determination of exchange rate in the short- and long-run, how currency risk can be hedged, how economic \u201cshocks\u201d are transmitted internationally and what policy can achieve in response. Additional topics covered include: determinants of economic growth in the long-run with lessons from Asia, rising economic integration in Asia and implications on currency regime, global imbalance and policy adjustments, and perspectives on financial crises.",

The module examines the notions of \u2018secularity\u2019 and \u2018post-secularity\u2019 and queries their relevance for the contemporary moment, within a comparative, historical perspective. Is it useful to invoke the concept of \u2018secularism\u2019 to make sense of encounters between religious and political domains? Do the ideas of the \u2018separation of church and state\u2019 and \u2018state non-interference in religion\u2019 help in these efforts?",

Students learn how control is exercised through case analyses, case presentations and in-class discussions. The case approach makes control &quot;come alive&quot; for the students with descriptions of control at various real organisations. The case presentations make the students think critically and strategically. The in-class discussions allow the students to evaluate the pros and cons of different approaches and solutions to control problems.",

  "description": "Sustainable development and environment protection is the important global theme in 21st century. It is well recognized by the world\u2019s scientific, industrial and political communities that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has been steadily increasing due to human activities and economic development, which accelerates the greenhouse effect. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mandated a reduction of CO2 emission levels to below those of 1990. To reduce the CO2 emission and maintain a desired balance in atmosphere, new technologies have been developed. CO2 capture and storage is one of the approaches. It is also possible to convert CO2 to some reusable hydrocarbons or chemicals through physical, chemical and biological processes. The most important challenge is how to activate CO2 economically as it has high thermodynamic stability. Solar energy should be one of the best candidates because it is totally clean and abundant. Consequently, the highly efficient and selective photochemical reduction systems for CO2 are highly desired. In addition, alternative energy resources and technologies also play vital roles in the reduction of CO2 emission.",

Is it necessarily true? Are there positive effects as well? This module will evaluate the link between the developmental process and the environment including an analysis of the problems, the proposed solutions, and the actual policies implemented.The module provides not only a Southeast Asian perspective on the environmental and the developmental issues facing the region, but also a geographical outlook. This emphasises the sharing of natural areas and resources among nation-states and their peoples in Southeast Asia given the historical background of the region with its impact on national borders and the composition of both the population and society. The outcome on nature and society relations seen in Southeast Asia reflect conditions specific to the region and its geography. This module is aimed at understanding both these specific conditions and the wider as well as external factors that have an impact on environment in Southeast Asia.",

The first part introduces the basic microeconomic theories of marginal analysis and competitive markets. It then develops principles of cost, strategic, and organizational analysis. These are useful in themselves, and also as fundamental building blocks for other disciplines, including cost accounting, corporate finance, marketing, and business strategy. The second part focuses on the roles of three major forces that will shape Asia's ability to sustain its dynamism as well as the ability of foreign firms to face the Asian challenge. These three forces are (1) business groups that dominate the corporate landscapes of many emerging economies in Asia, (2) governments that act both as regulators as well as players in competition with the private sector, and (3) frugal innovations that characterize the art of improvising effective solutions using limited resources. We look at the specific cultural and institutional contexts in Asia to understand how these three forces interact.",

Structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). Such structures exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future?

It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given.

Moreover, as a result of the expansion of global urban population, more food needs to be produced, moved to cities and distributed; insufficient food supply and inefficient food distribution systems will result in higher food prices. The global demand for more food results in the globalization of the food supply, increasing the risk of spreading food-borne diseases across international borders. Recent stories about tainted strawberries, infected chickens, mad cow disease, for instance, have increased public concern on the need of a safe food supply.

Dobzhansky emphasizes the importance of evolution as the only unifying concept in biology. Yet, the theory of evolution is more controversial and opposed by more forces in society than any other theory in science. The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\").",

  "description": "Effective marketing research is necessary for successful management of all phases of the marketing process, ranging from product development and introduction to selling through growth and maturity stages. In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing. (ii) To have the student gain perspective and practice in applying these skills through a research project. (iii) To develop an understanding of decision making in marketing, its inherent difficulties and pitfalls and the importance of information in marketing research.",

Structures and electronic and magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. To understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance spectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray absorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray photoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. We will also introduce scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future?

First of all, it helps to crystallize fundamental concepts and elucidate the roles they play in the theory. Secondly, it provides a unified framework for applications of the results and techniques of mathematical analysis. This module will cover the basic theory of metric spaces and sample applications to other areas of mathematics. It is highly recommended to students majoring in pure mathematics and to those who are interested in applied mathematics with an analytical flavour. Major topics: Euclidean spaces, inner product and Euclidean norm. Metric spaces: definition, examples. Topological concepts: open sets and closed sets, subspaces, density and separability. Convergence of sequences, completeness, nowhere dense sets, Baires category theorem and applications. Continuity of functions and uniform continuity. Compactness: open covers, Heine-Borel Theorem, extreme value theorem. Equivalences of compactness, sequential compactness, and completeness and total boundeness. Connectedness, characterizations of subintervals of the real line, intermediate value theorem, path-connectedness. Contraction mappings, Banachs fixed point theorem and applications.

  "description": "This module is a continuation of the foundation module on microeconomics. It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. The module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101. It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework. After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games. Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.",
