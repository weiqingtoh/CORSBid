Corspedia is an easy-to-use search engine for NUS CORS Bidding Archives.  
Try it out at [http://www.corspedia.com](http://www.corspedia.com).  
It is powered by [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Pure](http://purecss.io/). 

Background
--
Twice a year, NUS students will have to bid for modules through the [Centralised Online Undergraduate Registration System](http://www.nus.edu.sg/cors/). The interface is clunky, system is slow, information is messy. The serious students who want to be well-prepared for the various bidding rounds have no choice but to turn to the [CORS bidding history archives](http://www.nus.edu.sg/cors/archive.html) where the bidding statistics lives. However, students who have used it to do their researching get easily frustrated from using it; it's cumbersome to navigate back-and-forth between the semesters, rounds, and searching for the module of interest.

Solution
--
Corspedia aims to be the remedy of the above-mentioned problems. It provides a clean and simple interface for students to search for any module and displays the relevant results according to their profile: Faculty, New/Returning student and Programmes/General account.

Issues
--
We understand that Corspedia is far from perfect. Improvements and suggestions can reach us at [nuscorsinfo@gmail.com](<mailto:nuscorsinfo@gmail.com>).
